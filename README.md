##  :computer: Software Testing Engineer Turning Dyslexia into a Superpower

### Introdution

💬 My journey as a software testing engineer has been shaped by my unique perspective as a dyslexic individual. While dyslexia has presented challenges, it has also honed my problem-solving skills, allowing me to approach testing from unconventional angles and uncover hidden defects. This, coupled with my relentless determination to overcome obstacles, has made me an invaluable asset to any team.

My passion for software quality burns brightly. I take immense pride in crafting comprehensive test plans, designing meticulous test cases, and executing thorough testing to ensure that software products meet the highest standards of functionality, performance, and user experience.

As a continuous learner, I am committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements. I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set, particularly in the area of test automation. I am currently transitioning from manual testing to test automation and am eager to apply my expertise to streamline testing processes and enhance software quality.

I thrive in collaborative environments and work closely with developers and stakeholders to ensure seamless software development and testing processes. My communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to quality make me a valuable team player.

In the later half of 2023, my training in JavaScript and TypeScript has become increasingly relevant to my daily workflow. These programming languages are now at the forefront of software development, and I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to contribute to the creation of high-quality testing
